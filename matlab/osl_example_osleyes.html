The <tt>active_layer</tt> is the layer whose properties are displayed in the GUI controls and the layer whose colormap and color range are used for the colorbar displayed on screen. The layers are listed in the dropdown list in the GUI, and also in the <tt>niifiles</tt> property of the <tt>osleyes</tt> object:</p><pre class="codeinput">o.niifiles{:}

</pre><p>The active layer is 'tstat1_gc1_2mm.nii.gz' which is the third layer. To change the layer, simply set it to a different one</p><pre class="codeinput">o.active_layer = 1;
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_03.png" alt=""> <p>Notice how in the figure</p><div><ul><li>The dropdown list item has changed to the first layer</li><li>The color range now corresponds to the values in the standard brain image</li><li>The selected volume and volume count have updated.

The visibility of the tstat layer can be changed in two ways</p><div><ul><li>You could use the dropdown box to select the layer, and then the checkbox   to the left of the dropdown to turn the layer off</li><li>You can set the 'visible' property of the <tt>osleyes</tt> object to hide that   layer</li></ul></div><p>The 'visible' property is an array with as many elements as there are layers, and a value of 0 or 1 depending on whether the layer should be rendered or not. To hide the tstat layer, we can simply set the visibility of layer 3 to off</p><pre class="codeinput">o.visible(3) = 0;
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_04.png" alt=""> <p>Another way to change the visibility of a layer is by changing its opacity, which is in the <tt>layer_alpha</tt> property of the <tt>osleyes</tt> object - this is an array with as many entries as layers, and each entry is an opacity value between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque). So to render the tstat layer as semi-transparent, we can use</p><pre class="codeinput">o.layer_alpha(3) = 0.5;
o.visible(3) = 1;
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_05.png" alt=""> <h2 id="15">Moving around the plot</h2><p>Just like in <tt>fslview</tt> or <tt>fsleyes</tt>, you can change the slices that are displayed by clicking and dragging on any of the three brain images. As you move the mouse, the position of the crosshairs will change. The coordinates of the crosshairs in MNI coordinates are displayed as the 'XYZ' values in the figure. You can also retrieve them programatically through the <tt>current_point</tt> property of the <tt>osleyes</tt> object. This also lets you set which slices to render - for example</p><pre class="codeinput">o.current_point = [35  -55  -17];
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_06.png" alt=""> <h2 id="16">Colour scales</h2><p>Each layer has its own colormap and color range. These are stored in the <tt>colormaps</tt> and <tt>clims</tt> properties of the <tt>osleyes</tt> object, respectively. First, we will change to the parcel layer</p><pre class="codeinput">o.active_layer = 2;
o.layer_alpha(3) = 1;
o.visible(3) = 0;
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_07.png" alt=""> <p>We are working on the second layer, so need to work with the second entry in the 'clims' and 'colormaps' cell arrays. First, we will set the colour range. For example</p><pre class="codeinput">o.clims{2} = [10 50];
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_08.png" alt=""> <p>Notice that when the colour range is updated, the colorbar changes, the values in the color range in the GUI are changed, and the image is automatically re-rendered. One important point to be aware of is that values that are below the lower color limit are not displayed (i.e. they are made transparent) while values that are above the upper color limit are clipped to the highest colormap color.</p><p>You can also change the colormap. There are two ways to set the colormap</p><div><ul><li>You can provide a string that is the name of a colormap function on the   path, the same as normal Matlab colormaps. For example, 'jet'</li><li>You can provide a matrix of colormap RGB values - again, the same as with   the normal 'colormap' function in Matlab</li></ul></div><p>For example, to change to the jet colormap, we can use</p><pre class="codeinput">o.colormaps{2} = <span class="string">'jet'</span>;
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_09.png" alt=""> <p>Or a random colormap</p><pre class="codeinput">o.colormaps{2} = rand(10,3);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_10.png" alt=""> <p>A good colormap should be 'perceptually uniform' - qualitatively, this means the colormap should be designed that it doesn't induce the perception of features that aren't really present. This can happen if the colormap has perceptually larger changes over some value ranges than others. Matlab's built-in 'parula' colormap is one example of a perceptually uniform colormap. OSL includes the <tt>osl_colormap</tt> function which contains a set of perceptually uniform colormaps. These include</p><div><ul><li><tt>hot</tt> - red to yellow</li><li><tt>cold</tt> - blue to light blue</li><li><tt>rwb</tt> - red-blue with white in the middle</li><li><tt>rkb</tt> - red-blue with black in the middle</li><li><tt>green</tt> - green to light green</li><li><tt>grey</tt> or <tt>gray</tt> - greyscale</li></ul></div><p>The <tt>osl_colormap</tt> function returns a matrix of RGB values, and you can use these colormaps in normal Matlab plots by running <tt>colormap(osl_colormap('hot'))</tt>. Similarly, in <tt>osleyes</tt> you can pass the output of this function to the colormap property</p><pre class="codeinput">o.colormaps{2} = osl_colormap(<span class="string">'green'</span>);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_11.png" alt=""> <p>Lastly, sometimes it is necessary to select different colormaps for positive and negative values. To do this, you set the <tt>colormap</tt> property to a cell array containing two elements - the first entry contains the positive colormap, and the second contains the negative colormap</p><pre class="codeinput">o.colormaps{2} = {<span class="string">'jet'</span>,osl_colormap(<span class="string">'green'</span>)};
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_12.png" alt=""> <p>When you do this, values that are larger than the lower color limit will be rendered using the 'positive' scale, and values smaller than the lower color limit will be rendered using the 'negative' scale. The color limits for the positive scale will be the same as the color limit property, and the color limit for the negative scale will be the negative of these values.  This definition is unambiguous but extremely confusing if you set the color range to negative values, and especially if the magnitude of the upper limit is less than than the magnitude of the lower limit (e.g. <tt>[-1 -0.1]</tt>)</p><p><b>If using a bidirectional colormap, it is HIGHLY recommended that the color range spans positive values only!</b></p><h2 id="24">Setting a title</h2><p>The <tt>osleyes</tt> object has a <tt>title</tt> property which displays a plain text title on the plot. If the title string is empty, then no title will be displayed. If you set the title string, then the plot will automatically be resized to accommodate the title. For example</p><pre class="codeinput">o.title = <span class="string">'My Plot'</span>;
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_13.png" alt=""> <h2 id="25">Viewing different volumes</h2><p>Some NIFTI files contain a fourth dimension - for images like tstat maps, this could be time, and for images like parcellations, it could be parcel index. You can set which volume is displayed using the 'volume' text box in the GUI, or using the 'current_vols' property of the <tt>osleyes</tt> object. For example, to display the fifth volume of the tstat, we could use</p><pre class="codeinput">o.active_layer = 3;
o.visible(3) = 1;
o.current_vols(3) = 5;
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_14.png" alt=""> <p>With the GUI as the active window, you can use the up and down arrow keys to cycle through the volumes. The number of volumes in the active layer is also available in the <tt>nvols</tt> property of the <tt>osleyes</tt> object.</p><p>You can display a movie using the 'animate' method, which will programatically cycle through the images with a given frame rate. For example, to cycle through at 10 frames per second, use</p><pre class="language-matlab">o.animate(10)
</pre><p>
<video vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_animation_1.mp4" alt="" autoplay loop>
</p><p>The animation can be stopped by pressing Ctrl-C in the command window. The default frame rate is 30fps.</p><h2 id="29">Saving output figures</h2><p>You may not want to have the control panel and crosshairs visible if saving output figures. You can toggle their visibility programatically</p><pre class="codeinput">o.show_controls = 0;
o.show_crosshair = 0;
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_15.png" alt=""> <h2 id="30">Viewing the timeseries</h2><p>You can display a line plot of the data value across volumes at the current MNI coordinates by</p><div><ul><li>Right clicking on the plot and selecting 'Plot timeseries'</li><li>Calling the 'plot_timeseries' method on the <tt>osleyes</tt> object</li></ul></div><pre class="codeinput">o.show_controls = 1;
o.plot_timeseries()
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_16.png" alt=""> <img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_17.png" alt=""> <p>The red bar marks the current volume, and is updated if you set the current volume or run the animation</p><pre class="codeinput">o.current_vols(3) = 50;
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_18.png" alt=""> <img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_19.png" alt=""> <p>If you click on the timeseries plot, the current volume will be changed accordingly. Similarly, if you click on the main window to change the current coordinates, the timeseries will automatically update. The timeseries always corresponds to the active layer, and will update if you change the active layer. This may appear confusing if you change to a layer that only has one volume e.g.</p><pre class="codeinput">o.active_layer = 2;
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_20.png" alt=""> <img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_21.png" alt=""> <p>A warning will be displayed on the timeseries plot if this is the case.</p><h2 id="34">Formatting via input options</h2><p>In addition to the NII files, you can also pass additional options to the <tt>osleyes</tt> object. This could allow you to programatically format multiple plots, or to pass complete formatting options from one function to another. These options take the form of key-value pairs. Each key corresponds to a property of the object, and each value corresponds to what you want to assign to that property after construction. For example</p><pre class="codeinput">close <span class="string">all</span>
o = osleyes({[],nii_roi,nii_tstat},<span class="string">'colormaps'</span>,{<span class="string">'jet'</span>,<span class="string">'hsv'</span>,osl_colormap(<span class="string">'green'</span>)},<span class="string">'clims'</span>,{[],[0 5],[1 5]},<span class="string">'show_crosshair'</span>,false,<span class="string">'current_vols'</span>,[1 1 50]);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_22.png" alt=""> <p>is exactly equivalent to</p><pre class="language-matlab">o = osleyes({[],nii_roi,nii_tstat});
o.colormaps = {<span class="string">'jet'</span>,<span class="string">'hsv'</span>,<span class="string">'autumn'</span>};
o.clims = {[],[0 5],[1 5]};
o.show_crosshair = false;
o.current_vols = [1 1 50]
</pre><p>Notice that we have specified two input files, but because a standard mask has automatically been added, there are three layers in the final image. This means that the <tt>colormaps</tt> and <tt>clims</tt> properties need to have three entries, because there are three layers. You can leave the <tt>colormap</tt> or the <tt>clim</tt> empty for any layer to leave its value unchanged. The same is true for other layer-wise properties such as <tt>current_vols</tt> or <tt>layer_alpha</tt>, but for these you need to provide a specific value.</p><h2 id="37">Putting it all together</h2><p>Suppose we wanted to make an animation of the tstat, with the parcel overlaid as a semitransparent volume with fixed colour.

%% Utilities - osleyes
%
% As an alternative to |fslview| or |fsleyes|, OSL includes its own NIFTI file
% viewer, |osleyes|. The main advantages of |osleyes| are
%
% * Pure MATLAB implementation, does not require FSL
% * Loads faster than starting |fslview| or |fsleyes| externally
% * Controllable and scriptable from MATLAB
% * Easy to save high resolution figure outputs
%
% The main limitations are
%
% * Not as extensively tested as |fsleyes|
% * May have issues with files that have unusual xform
%   transformations, data types, or scalings. There is a low likelihood of
%   this being a problem in typical MEG analysis usage of OSL, but is a
%   limitation to keep in mind if using |osleyes| as a general NIFTI viewer

%% Loading files
% Loading files is simple. First we specify some files
nii_parcels = fullfile(osldir,'parcellations','dk_cortical.nii.gz');
nii_roi = fullfile(osldir,'example_data','osleyes_example','Right_Temporal_Occipital_Fusiform_Cortex_8mm.nii.gz');
nii_tstat = fullfile(osldir,'example_data','osleyes_example','tstat1_gc1_8mm.nii.gz');
nii_std_brain = fullfile(osldir,'std_masks','MNI152_T1_8mm_brain.nii.gz');

%%
% And now load with a call to |osleyes|
osleyes(nii_tstat);

%%
% Notice how
%
% * The dropdown list shows the list of layers/images in the plot. A standard
%   brain has automatically been selected
% * The range of data values was automatically chosen, and because some values
%   were negative, a two-sided colormap has automatically been chosen
%
% The first argument to |osleyes| specifies which images you want to display.
% This can either be the name of a single file, or a cell array of files. If
% you specify a single image, then a standard brain will automatically be
% selected based on the size of the image. If you specify a cell array, then
% leave the first item empty to have it automatically load in the brain image.
% So the above command is equivalent to

%%
%
%   osleyes({[],nii_tstat});
%

%%
% If you don't want to have a standard brain image selected, then omit this
% first item e.g.

%%
%
%   osleyes({nii_tstat});
%

%%
% To display more than one layer, you must use the cell array input option e.g. 
%
%   osleyes({[],nii_roi,nii_tstat});
%

%%
% Note that the standard brain is selected based on the first layer that you
% specify - in the above example, the spatial resolution would be chosen based
% on |nii_roi| rather than |nii_tstat|. This may be an issue for you if you
% want to plot several layers with different spatial resolutions. In that
% case, you may wish the explicitly specify the standard brain you wish to use
close all
o = osleyes({nii_std_brain,nii_roi,nii_tstat});

%%
% Notice how the |osleyes| constructor returns an |osleyes| object. This
% object is tied to the figure displayed on screen. You can manipulate the
% object to change what is displayed in the figure. The handle for this object
% is stored in the figure itself. If you forgot to capture the |osleyes|
% object during construction, you can select the figure, and recover the
% object using
o = get(gcf,'osleyes')

%%
% Similarly, the |osleyes| object contains a handle to the figure that it is
% bound to, if you want to operate on the figure associated with the object
o.fig

%% Selecting layers 
% Each image is a layer/overlay in the viewer. The order of
% the layers is determined by the order of the input nii files. For simplicity
% in implementation, you cannot change the nii files or their ordering after
% you have created the figure - if you want to change these properties, just
% make a new |osleyes| figure. However, you can change things like the colour
% map, range, and visibility of the layers afterwards. Each layer has several
% key properties
%
% * |visibility| - whether the layer is drawn or not
% * |current_vol| - for images that have more than one volume (i.e. a 4D image),
%   which volume is being displayed
% * |clim| - the colour range limits
% * |colormap| - which colormap is used for the layer
% * |alpha| - opacity value for the layer
%
% All of these properties can be set programatically by interacting with the
% |osleyes| object, and for convenience, the visibility, current volume, and
% color range can also be set in the GUI. The |active_layer| is the layer
% whose properties are displayed in the GUI controls and the layer whose
% colormap and color range are used for the colorbar displayed on screen. The
% layers are listed in the dropdown list in the GUI, and also in the
% |niifiles| property of the |osleyes| object:
o.niifiles{:}

%%
% The active layer is 'tstat1_gc1_2mm.nii.gz' which is the third layer. To
% change the layer, simply set it to a different one
o.active_layer = 1;

%%
% Notice how in the figure
%
% * The dropdown list item has changed to the first layer
% * The color range now corresponds to the values in the standard brain image
% * The selected volume and volume count have updated. The volume selection
%   field is greyed out because there is only one volume in the layer
% * The 'Value' readout corresponding to the data value at the position marked
%   by the crosshair displays the value of this layer
%
% Although the standard brain image is present, it cannot be seen because it
% is hidden by the tstat layer. The visibility of the tstat layer can be
% changed in two ways
%
% * You could use the dropdown box to select the layer, and then the checkbox
%   to the left of the dropdown to turn the layer off
% * You can set the 'visible' property of the |osleyes| object to hide that
%   layer
% 
% The 'visible' property is an array with as many elements as there are
% layers, and a value of 0 or 1 depending on whether the layer should be
% rendered or not. To hide the tstat layer, we can simply set the visibility
% of layer 3 to off
o.visible(3) = 0;

%%
% Another way to change the visibility of a layer is by changing its opacity,
% which is in the |layer_alpha| property of the |osleyes| object - this is an
% array with as many entries as layers, and each entry is an opacity value
% between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque). So to render the tstat
% layer as semi-transparent, we can use
o.layer_alpha(3) = 0.5;
o.visible(3) = 1;

%% Moving around the plot
% Just like in |fslview| or |fsleyes|, you can change the slices that are displayed
% by clicking and dragging on any of the three brain images. As you move the
% mouse, the position of the crosshairs will change. The coordinates of the
% crosshairs in MNI coordinates are displayed as the 'XYZ' values in the
% figure. You can also retrieve them programatically through the
% |current_point| property of the |osleyes| object. This also lets you set
% which slices to render - for example
o.current_point = [35  -55  -17];

%% Colour scales
% Each layer has its own colormap and color range. These are stored in the
% |colormaps| and |clims| properties of the |osleyes| object, respectively.
% First, we will change to the parcel layer
o.active_layer = 2;
o.layer_alpha(3) = 1;
o.visible(3) = 0;

%%
% We are working on the second layer, so need to work with the second entry in
% the 'clims' and 'colormaps' cell arrays. First, we will set the colour
% range. For example
o.clims{2} = [10 50];

%%
% Notice that when the colour range is updated, the colorbar changes, the
% values in the color range in the GUI are changed, and the image is
% automatically re-rendered. One important point to be aware of is that values
% that are below the lower color limit are not displayed (i.e. they are made
% transparent) while values that are above the upper color limit are clipped
% to the highest colormap color.

%%
% You can also change the colormap. There are two ways to set the colormap
%
% * You can provide a string that is the name of a colormap function on the
%   path, the same as normal Matlab colormaps. For example, 'jet'
% * You can provide a matrix of colormap RGB values - again, the same as with
%   the normal 'colormap' function in Matlab
%
% For example, to change to the jet colormap, we can use
o.colormaps{2} = 'jet';

%%
% Or a random colormap
o.colormaps{2} = rand(10,3);

%%
% A good colormap should be 'perceptually uniform' - qualitatively, this means
% the colormap should be designed that it doesn't induce the perception of
% features that aren't really present. This can happen if the colormap has
% perceptually larger changes over some value ranges than others. Matlab's
% built-in 'parula' colormap is one example of a perceptually uniform
% colormap. OSL includes the |osl_colormap| function which contains a set of
% perceptually uniform colormaps. These include
%
% * |hot| - red to yellow
% * |cold| - blue to light blue
% * |rwb| - red-blue with white in the middle
% * |rkb| - red-blue with black in the middle
% * |green| - green to light green
% * |grey| or |gray| - greyscale
%
% The |osl_colormap| function returns a matrix of RGB values, and you can use
% these colormaps in normal Matlab plots by running
% |colormap(osl_colormap('hot'))|. Similarly, in |osleyes| you can pass the
% output of this function to the colormap property
o.colormaps{2} = osl_colormap('green');

%%
% Lastly, sometimes it is necessary to select different colormaps for positive
% and negative values. To do this, you set the |colormap| property to a cell
% array containing two elements - the first entry contains the positive
% colormap, and the second contains the negative colormap
o.colormaps{2} = {'jet',osl_colormap('green')};

%%
% When you do this, values that are larger than the lower color limit will be
% rendered using the 'positive' scale, and values smaller than the lower color
% limit will be rendered using the 'negative' scale. The color limits for the
% positive scale will be the same as the color limit property, and the color
% limit for the negative scale will be the negative of these values.  This
% definition is unambiguous but extremely confusing if you set the color range
% to negative values, and especially if the magnitude of the upper limit is
% less than than the magnitude of the lower limit (e.g. |[-1 -0.1]|)
%
% *If using a bidirectional colormap, it is HIGHLY recommended that the color
% range spans positive values only!*

%% Setting a title
% The |osleyes| object has a |title| property which displays a plain text
% title on the plot. If the title string is empty, then no title will be
% displayed. If you set the title string, then the plot will automatically be
% resized to accommodate the title. For example
o.title = 'My Plot';

%% Viewing different volumes
% Some NIFTI files contain a fourth dimension - for images like tstat maps,
% this could be time, and for images like parcellations, it could be parcel
% index. You can set which volume is displayed using the 'volume' text box in
% the GUI, or using the 'current_vols' property of the |osleyes| object. For
% example, to display the fifth volume of the tstat, we could use
o.active_layer = 3;
o.visible(3) = 1;
o.current_vols(3) = 5;

%%
% With the GUI as the active window, you can use the up and down arrow keys to
% cycle through the volumes. The number of volumes in the active layer is also
% available in the |nvols| property of the |osleyes| object.
%
% You can display a movie using the 'animate' method, which will
% programatically cycle through the images with a given frame rate. For
% example, to cycle through at 10 frames per second, use
%
%   o.animate(10)

%%
% <html>
% <video vspace="5" hspace="5" src="osl_example_osleyes_animation_1.mp4" alt="" autoplay loop> 
% </html>

%%
% The animation can be stopped by pressing Ctrl-C in the command window. The default frame rate is 30fps. 

%% Saving output figures
% You may not want to have the control panel and crosshairs visible if saving
% output figures. You can toggle their visibility programatically
o.show_controls = 0;
o.show_crosshair = 0;

%% Viewing the timeseries
% You can display a line plot of the data value across volumes at the current MNI coordinates by
% 
% * Right clicking on the plot and selecting 'Plot timeseries'
% * Calling the 'plot_timeseries' method on the |osleyes| object
o.show_controls = 1;
o.plot_timeseries()

%%
% The red bar marks the current volume, and is updated if you set the current volume or run the animation
o.current_vols(3) = 50;

%%
% If you click on the timeseries plot, the current volume will be changed
% accordingly. Similarly, if you click on the main window to change the
% current coordinates, the timeseries will automatically update. The
% timeseries always corresponds to the active layer, and will update if you
% change the active layer. This may appear confusing if you change to a layer
% that only has one volume e.g.
o.active_layer = 2;

%%
% A warning will be displayed on the timeseries plot if this is the case. 

%% Formatting via input options
% In addition to the NII files, you can also pass additional options to the
% |osleyes| object. This could allow you to programatically format multiple
% plots, or to pass complete formatting options from one function to another.
% These options take the form of key-value pairs. Each key corresponds to a
% property of the object, and each value corresponds to what you want to
% assign to that property after construction. For example
close all
o = osleyes({[],nii_roi,nii_tstat},'colormaps',{'jet','hsv',osl_colormap('green')},'clims',{[],[0 5],[1 5]},'show_crosshair',false,'current_vols',[1 1 50]);

%%
% is exactly equivalent to
%
%   o = osleyes({[],nii_roi,nii_tstat});
%   o.colormaps = {'jet','hsv','autumn'};
%   o.clims = {[],[0 5],[1 5]};
%   o.show_crosshair = false;
%   o.current_vols = [1 1 50]

%%
% Notice that we have specified two input files, but because a standard mask
% has automatically been added, there are three layers in the final image.
% This means that the |colormaps| and |clims| properties need to have three
% entries, because there are three layers. You can leave the |colormap| or the
% |clim| empty for any layer to leave its value unchanged. The same is true
% for other layer-wise properties such as |current_vols| or |layer_alpha|, but
% for these you need to provide a specific value.

%% Putting it all together
% Suppose we wanted to make an animation of the tstat, with the parcel
% overlaid as a semitransparent volume with fixed colour. We could do this
% with
%
%   close all
%   o = osleyes({[],nii_tstat,nii_roi}); % Put the ROI layer on top
%   o.current_point = [34  -50  -13]; % Set the coordinate for the slice
%   o.colormaps{3} = [0 1 0]; % Make the ROI green
%   o.layer_alpha(3) = 0.4; % Make the ROI transparent
%   o.active_layer = 2; % Display colorbar for the tstat layer
%   o.colormaps{2} = osl_colormap('hot'); % Use single sided colormap
%   o.clims{2} = [0 10]; % clip colour at upper end
%   o.show_controls = 0; % Hide the controls
%   o.show_crosshair = 0; % Hide the crosshair
%   v = VideoWriter('test.mp4','MPEG-4');
%   open(v)
%   for j = 1:o.nvols % Iterate over volumes
%   	o.title = sprintf('t=%d',j);
%   	o.current_vols(2) = j;
%   	writeVideo(v,frame2im(getframe(o.fig)))
%   end
%   close(v)
