This can be used to represent any linear operation, including ICA artefact rejection, beamforming, parcellation, and leakage correction.

%% Data structures - MEEG and NIFTI 
%
% There are a handful of useful data structures provided by SPM and OSL to
% facilitate working with MEG data. Becoming comfortable with these data
% structures will help when working with OSL. This example gives a (very
% brief) overview of the two most important containers for MEG data and for
% MRI data used in OSL.

%% SPM MEEG objects
% First up is the MEEG object. This is a container for the actual MEG data
% itself. These live on
% disk in two files
%
% * a |.dat| file, which contains the time series data
% * a |.mat| that contains header information
%
% You can load this object into Matlab using |spm_eeg_load|:

%%
%

D = spm_eeg_load(fullfile(osldir,'example_data','roinets_example','subject_1'))

%%
% You can access the data by indexing this object
x = D(:,:,:);
size(x)

%%
% For continuous data, this matrix will be channels x time. For epoched data,
% there is an additional dimension corresponding to trial. You can access the
% time points easily as well, and use this to quickly plot your data
t = D.time;
plot(t,x(3,:))
xlabel('Time')
ylabel('Signal value')

%%
% How do you know what signal you are plotting? You can get information from
% the header about the channels
D.chanlabels(3) % channel name
D.chantype(3) % type of sensor
D.units(3) % data units

%%
% and there are other useful properties about the data in the MEEG object
D.fsample % Sampling rate
D.nchannels % Number of channels
D.fname % Name of the mat file

%%
% If you make changes to the MEEG object, these can be saved to disk using
D.save();

%%
% To copy the file, use
D2 = D.copy('./test');

%%
% This is one potentially confusing part of MEEG objects - most of their
% methods return new MEEG objects. So for example
D.fname
D2.fname

%%
% Now we will experiment with changing information in the header
clear D D2
D = spm_eeg_load('test.mat')

%%
% We have loaded the new copy so that we don't accidentally make changes to
% the original data. Most properties of MEEG objects need to be set through
% their methods. For example, we can set the sampling rate using
D.fsample(200)

%%
% But there is a catch!
D.fsample

%%
% As you can see, |D.fsample(200)| returns a new MEEG object, without changing
% the old object. So we need to do
D = D.fsample(200);
D.fsample

%%
% This change is not automatically saved to disk. For example
D = spm_eeg_load('test.mat');
D.fsample

%%
% We need to save the updated header to disk manually
D = D.fsample(200);
D.save()
D = spm_eeg_load('test.mat');
D.fsample

%%
% This changes the contents of the '.mat' file but not the '.dat' file,
% because the raw data itself hasn't changed. One extremely important thing to
% understand about MEEG objects is that they memory-map the .dat file. This
% means when you run |D(1,:,:)| you are indexing into the .dat file directly.
% While changing the header requires saving the MEEG object, any changes you
% make to the raw data occur on disk immediately. So for example
D(1,1)
D(1,1) = 0

%%
% This immediately writes a value of 0 to disk. So if we reload the MEEG object:
D = spm_eeg_load('test.mat');
D(1,1)

%%
% You can see the change persists even though '.save()' was never called. This
% is the main reason why some OSL operations return a MEEG object without
% making changes on disk (because they change the header, which is only
% written when 'save()' is called) while others make copies of the MEEG object
% (e.g. filtering results in a new file with a prefix of 'f' because otherwise
% the original data would be instantly overwritten). It's important to keep
% this in mind, because if you happen to run
D(:,:,:) = 0

%%
% your data is now gone, and you would need to restore it from a separate
% backup (which you presumably made before starting!). In our case, we can
% just reload the original file (before we copied it) - and make a new copy,
% just to be safe!
D = spm_eeg_load(fullfile(osldir,'example_data','roinets_example','subject_1'))
D.copy('./test');

%%
% The final important aspect of MEEG objects is the 'online montage'. An

% be used to represent any linear operation, including ICA artefact rejection,
% beamforming, parcellation, and leakage correction. Writing these
% combinations as linear transformations rather than actual data enables a
% considerable saving of disk space. You can list the montages present using
% |has_montage|
has_montage(D)

%%
% To switch montages, you can use
D.nchannels
D = D.montage('switch',2);
D.nchannels

%%
% Montage 0 corresponds to the raw sensor data. You can also get information
% about the montage, including the linear transformation matrix
D.montage('getmontage',2)

%%
% To add an online montage of your own, use the |add_montage| function. For
% example, if we have a single channel that we want to correspond to the sum
% of all of the sensors, we could use
D = D.montage('switch',0);
tmp = sum(D(:,1)) % The target value at the first timepoint
D = add_montage(D,ones(1,D.nchannels),'My new montage');
has_montage(D)
D(1,1) 

%%
% Note that because the montage information is stored in the header, the
% |save()| method must be used to save changes that affect montages e.g.
D = spm_eeg_load(fullfile(osldir,'example_data','roinets_example','subject_1'));
has_montage(D)


%% NIFTI files
% NIFTI files are typically used to store volumetric image data, for example,
% structural scans. Fundamentally they are simply a means of storing a
% multidimensional matrix in a binary file. They come in two varieties
%
% * |.nii| which is the file itself
% * |.nii.gz| which is a gzipped version of the |.nii| file.
%
% Most programs designed to work with NIFTI files will accept either kind of
% file. Here are some NIFTI files that are supplied with OSL
standard_brain = fullfile(osldir,'std_masks','MNI152_T1_1mm_brain.nii.gz');
standard_4mm_brain = fullfile(osldir,'std_masks','MNI152_T1_4mm_brain.nii.gz');
ft_4mm_brain = fullfile(osldir,'std_masks','ft_4mm_brain.nii.gz');

%%
% The first is a standard brain image, the second is a weighted parcellation. You can load the data in these files into MATLAB using
vol = nii.load(standard_brain);
size(vol)

%%
% If you have previously used OSL, note that |nii.load| is equivalent to
% |read_avw| except it does not require FSL. When you use |nii.load|, the
% contents of the NIFTI file are loaded in as a matrix. However, what is the

% which part of space the matrix occupies. You can do this with the xform

% system in which to interpret the matrix, as well as accounting for any
% transformations (e.g. deformations) that should be applied to the data. This
% matrix is also read in by |nii.load|
[vol,res,xform] = nii.load(standard_brain);
res
xform

%%
% To save a NIFTI file, you can use |nii.save()|. 
nii.save(vol,res,xform,'newfile.nii.gz');

%%
% Make sure that you include the extension (|.nii| or |.nii.gz|) when saving
