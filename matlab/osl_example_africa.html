##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Preproc - AFRICA (ICA artefact removal)
%
% OSL provides a framework for employing Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
% to remove certain artefacts from MEG data. Using this framework, sources of
% interference, such as eye-blinks, ECG and line noise, can be separated from
% the genuine MEG data and removed.
% 

%%
% To use ICA denoising, you will use the function osl_africa.m. osl_africa can
% currently be applied to Elekta Neuromag and CTF data.
% 
% The de-noising process has three stages:
%
% *1. Decomposition of data into independent components.*
%
% * Here, the MEG data is extracted from the SPM object.
% * Each sensor type is normalised by its smallest eigenvalue.
% * Bad epochs (as defined by |oslview|), bad trials and bad channels are
%   removed.
% * |fastica| is used to decompose the data into a set of independent time
%   courses and associated topographies.
% * The default parameters are recommended.
%
% *2. Classification of artefact components*
%
% * This stage will require user-input.
%
% *3. Subtraction of artefact components from data to yield denoised data.* 
%
% * This final stage is automated and should not require any user input.
% * The independent time courses are subtracted from the MEG data. This is
%   implemented via the spm_eeg_montage function which means that subsequent
%   leadfields will be corrected.
%
% To start, load an MEEG object

D = spm_eeg_load(fullfile(osldir,'example_data','preproc_example','manual','subject1_spm_meeg.mat'))

%%
% The main entry point is the function |osl_africa|. The first argument is the
% MEEG object, and then key-value pairs of options. The most important options
% to be aware of are
% 
% # |do_ica| - Perform the ICA decomposition (stage 1, time consuming)
% # |do_ident| - Classify ICA components and select bad channels
% # |do_remove| - Use the bad channels to write an online montage
% # |used_maxfilter| - If working with Elekta data, identify fewer components
% # |ident_func| - Select the identification function (more below)
%
% By default, all three stages will be run, and manual component selection
% will be used. As we are working with Elekta data , make sure that
% |used_maxfilter| is set. To run only the first stage, use

D = osl_africa(D,'do_ica',true,'do_ident',false,'do_remove',false,'used_maxfilter',true);

%%
% For the example data, this should take on the order of 2 minutes, depending
% on your computer. It could potentially be much longer depending on your
% data. *It is important that you remove bad segments from the data using
% |oslview()| prior to running |osl_africa()| as this will have a big effect
% on the inference of the components.*. A new field has been added to the MEEG
% object storing the results of the calculation

D.ica

%%
% In general, |osl_africa| makes changes in memory and returns an MEEG object
% that can optionally be saved, rather than writing changes to disk
% automatically. However, because ICA is potentially very time consuming,
% these results are automatically saved to disk. It's possible to end up in a
% confusing situation - for example
%
%   D = spm_eeg_load(fname)
%   D.ica % Error because field does not exist
%   osl_africa(D) % ICA results saved to disk
%   D.ica % Error because D has not been reloaded
%   D = spm_eeg_load(fname)
%   D.ica % Results work
%
% To avoid this, make sure you use |D = osl_africa(D,...)| rather than
% |osl_africa(D,...)|.
%
% It is also worth remembering that the ICA algorithm is randomly initialized,
% which means that if you run it again, you might not get the same
% decomposition. To make your results reproducible, set the random number
% generator in Matlab (e.g. |rng(0)|) before running |osl_africa|.
%
% If ICA results are present, |osl_africa| will not rerun the ICA stage by
% default unless you set |do_ica| to |true|. There are two artefact rejection
% modes - automatic, which will classify the ICA components based on various
% criteria, and manual. The manual mode opens a GUI that you can use to inspect
% and classify artefacts with. To display it, use:

D = osl_africa(D,'do_ident','manual','do_remove',false);

%%
% This opens the ICA component identification GUI. Often you will want to
% compare the ICA components to other sensor data such as EOG and EMG. These
% are the defaults, but you can specify the chantypes for the channels you
% want to correlate the components with explicitly:

D = osl_africa(D,'do_ident','manual','do_remove',false,'artefact_channels',{'EOG','ECG'});

%%
% Mark a component as bad using the red cross button  toolbar, and then close
% the GUI. If you inspect D, you can see that the bad components have been
% marked in |D.ica.bad_components|. At the moment, there are no online
% montages. To remove these components via an online montage, use

has_montage(D);
D = osl_africa(D,'do_ident',false,'do_remove',true);

%%
% Note that with |do_ident=false| the classification step will be skipped, and the rejection
% will proceed with whatever is already marked in |D.ica.bad_components|. 

has_montage(D);

%%
% Remember that these changes are only in memory, and you need to use |D.save()| to
% write the changes to disk. Normally you would run both the identification
% and the component removal in a single step, using
%
%   D = osl_africa(D)
%
% Note that if you run this now, you will have two online montages
%
%   has_montage(D)
%
% It can be helpful to delete any unwanted montages prior
% to using |osl_africa| e.g.
%
%   D = D.montage('remove',1) % Remove the first montage
%   has_montage(D)
%

%% Automatic component removal
%
% You can use automatic rejection by setting 'do_ident' to 'auto' (which is the default). 
% For example

D_automatic = osl_africa(D,'used_maxfilter',1,'artefact_channels',{'EOG','ECG'})

%%
% This will automatically assign the bad components. If you redo the manual
% artefact selection, you can make changes to the assignment if you like.
D_touchup = osl_africa(D_automatic,'do_ident','manual','used_maxfilter',1,'artefact_channels',{'EOG','ECG'});

%%
% There are a number of additional options available for the automatic rejection. These are
%
% * |auto_max_num_artefact_comps| - Maximum number of new components to reject for each reason
% * |auto_do_mains| - whether to identify mains components (false by default)
% * |auto_mains_kurt_thresh| - Reject components where the highest power in near the mains frequency and the kurtosis exceeds this threshold
% * |auto_do_kurt| - Reject components based on kurtosis
% * |auto_kurtosis_thresh| - Reject components where the kurtosis exceeds this value
% * |auto_kurtosis_wthresh| - Detect outliers in kurtosis - raise this to detect more outliers
% * |auto_artefact_chans_corr_thresh| - Reject components whose correlation with one of the artefact channels exceeds this value
%
% The default values are generally a good starting point.

%% Effect of including artefacts in the data
% As discussed above, it is important that bad epochs are excluded prior to running AFRICA. There are actually two problems that can occur if you don't remove
% them
%
% * You might not be able to identify components that correlate with any of the artefact channels
% * You might find a component that looks like an artefact channel, but it does not get removed correctly
%
% The latter point is particularly subtle because it is possible to miss this entirely if you do not inspect the
% sensor data after running AFRICA. In this tutorial example, we have run AFRICA thus far without including any artefact rejection. However, the timeseries contains
% a number of artefacts. We can plot the raw data for one of the sensors before and after AFRICA
D1 = D_automatic.montage('switch',0); % Raw sensors
D2 = D_automatic.montage('switch',D_automatic.montage('getnumber')); % Result after AFRICA
figure
plot(D1.time,[D1(1,:).',D2(1,:)']);

%%
% As you can see, there are large artefacts in the middle and especially towards the end of the recording. Now we will zoom in to see what the ICA removal has 
% done
set(gca,'XLim',[120 125],'YLim',[-1 1]*1e-10)

%%
% The artefact removal is completely wrong - the ECG component has been _introduced_ into the sensor data even more strongly than it was originally present!
% It's critical that the artefacts are removed completely. We can do this by excluding the bad times. Normally you would do this with either |oslview| or |osl_detect_artefacts|. 
% For this tutorial, we will just add these artefact times in directly
ev(1) = struct('type','artefact_OSL','value','all','duration',81.7271,'time',310.0822,'offset',0);
ev(2) = struct('type','artefact_OSL','value','all','duration',334.6752,'time',593.3288,'offset',0);
D_automatic = events(D_automatic,1,ev);

%%
% Now we will rerun the ICA by setting |do_ica=true|
D_automatic = osl_africa(D_automatic,'do_ica',true,'used_maxfilter',1,'artefact_channels',{'EOG','ECG'})

%%
% Now we can go back to the time series and verify that the ICA component is now correctly removed
figure
plot(D1.time,[D1(1,:).',D_automatic(1,:)']);
set(gca,'XLim',[120 125],'YLim',[-1 1]*1e-10)

%% Description of method in publications
%
% Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to decompose the sensor data for
% each session into 150 temporally independent components (tICs) and associated
% sensor topographies using FastICA (http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica).
% Artifact components were classified via the following procedure. Eye-blink,
% cardiac and mains interference components were manually identified by the
% combined inspection of the spatial topography, time course, kurtosis of the
% time course and frequency spectrum for all components. Eye-blink artifacts
% typically exhibited high kurtosis (>20), a repeated blink structure in the
% time course and very structured spatial topographies. Cardiac component time
% courses strongly resembled the typical ECG signals, as well as having high
% kurtosis (>20). Mains interference had extremely low kurtosis (typically <â1)
% and a frequency spectrum dominated by 50 Hz line noise. Artefacts were then
% rejected by subtracting them out of the data.
