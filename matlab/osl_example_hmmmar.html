The HMM-Gaussian, which is run on the power time series. The power time series   reflects the fluctuations in the amplitude of signal. Therefore, this   variant of the HMM captures changes in the instantaneous power, as well as   changes in the power correlations across regions. This model is   appropriate when we have many channels and we only want to focus on   power changes.</p><p>2. The HMM-MAR, where each state is an multivariate autoregressive model (MAR).   The MAR is essentially a linear dynamical system that captures   information of the power of the signals and the phase relations between   the different channels; also, these properties are defined as a   function of frequency (for 10Hz, for 15Hz, etc). The HMM-MAR therefore   is able to pick up on more nuanced information than the HMM-Gaussian.   This model is appropriate when we have spectrally and temporally rich   data, but it is not appropriate when we have more than a few channels.</p><p>3. The TDE-HMM, where each state is a cross-covariance matrix, defined   across space and time. This cross-covariance matrix also contains   information of power and phase relations between the different channels   for each frequency; however, the amount of detail that it has on these   quantities is considerably lower than the HMM-MAR (that is, it can be   considered a simplification of the HMM-MAR model). For this reason, the   TDE-HMM is a good model when we want to model many channels (e.g. MEG   across the entire brain) while having some information of the phase.</p><p>Note that the toolbox is called HMM-MAR only for historical reasons, but contains all these three models (and more). This can be a bit confusing - in what follows, by HMM-MAR we will refer to the HMM with an autoregressive observation model (not to the software package)</p><!--/introduction--><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% We will first set up the necessary directories</span>

%% HMM - resting state and task data
%
% This example shows how to use the HMM to infer transient states
% based on their spectral characteristics.
%
% Three possible models are used: 
%
% 1. The HMM-Gaussian, which is run on the power time series. The power time series 
%   reflects the fluctuations in the amplitude of signal. Therefore, this
%   variant of the HMM captures changes in the instantaneous power, as well as 
%   changes in the power correlations across regions. This model is
%   appropriate when we have many channels and we only want to focus on
%   power changes. 
%
% 2. The HMM-MAR, where each state is an multivariate autoregressive model (MAR).
%   The MAR is essentially a linear dynamical system that captures
%   information of the power of the signals and the phase relations between
%   the different channels; also, these properties are defined as a
%   function of frequency (for 10Hz, for 15Hz, etc). The HMM-MAR therefore
%   is able to pick up on more nuanced information than the HMM-Gaussian.
%   This model is appropriate when we have spectrally and temporally rich
%   data, but it is not appropriate when we have more than a few channels. 
%
% 3. The TDE-HMM, where each state is a cross-covariance matrix, defined
%   across space and time. This cross-covariance matrix also contains
%   information of power and phase relations between the different channels
%   for each frequency; however, the amount of detail that it has on these
%   quantities is considerably lower than the HMM-MAR (that is, it can be 
%   considered a simplification of the HMM-MAR model). For this reason, the
%   TDE-HMM is a good model when we want to model many channels (e.g. MEG
%   across the entire brain) while having some information of the phase. 
%
% Note that the toolbox is called HMM-MAR only for historical reasons,
% but contains all these three models (and more). 
% This can be a bit confusing - in what follows, by HMM-MAR we will refer to the
% HMM with an autoregressive observation model (not to the software package)

%% 

% We will first set up the necessary directories

% Software directories: **you need to update OSLCOURSE_dir** to your local directory
OSLCOURSE_dir = '/Users/dvidaurre/Work/Matlab/ohba_analysis/';
HMMMAR_dir = [OSLCOURSE_dir '/HMM-MAR'];
OSLDIR = [OSLCOURSE_dir '/osl-core'];

data_dir = [OSLCOURSE_dir 'OSL_course/data_HMM/'];

% Atlas file, necessary to show the maps
atlasfile = [OSLCOURSE_dir '/parcellations/fmri_d100_parcellation_with_PCC_tighterMay15_v2_8mm.nii.gz'];

% HMM-MAR is standalone, so it does not hold any dependence with OSL or
% other software packages
addpath(genpath(HMMMAR_dir))

% if true, it will use precomputed results; set it to false to run yourself
precomputed_results = true;
% if true, it will call osleyes to show spatial maps with the HMM states
show_maps_osleyes = true;

% We load the continuous data, for one subject
% This 50 min of MEG data, 38 ROIs. The variables contained in this data file are: 
%
% - The time series X, with dimension (time by channels)
%
% - A vector T, containing the length of each

%%
% For the HMM-Gaussian, states reflect 
% distinct, recurrent patterns of power
% and functional connectivity (in terms of power correlation).
%
% For this, perform the following steps, which are all implemented in the
% HMM toolbox
%
% 1. Bandpass-filtering: we would be discarding very slow and very fast frequencies, 
%   although we also could use it to focus on a particular band of interest. 
%
% 2. Getting power time courses: using the Hilbert transform we will get rid of the phase,
%   information, producing time series that reflect only the changes on power. 
%
% 3. Subsampling: because power changes are slow, we can afford downsampling the data to reduce
%   the computational load without losing statistical power on the estimation. 
%   Also, downsampling will enhance the estimates of functional connectivity.
%
% This is the method established in Baker et al. (2014), but here applied on task data
%
% Again, note that, although this uses the hmmmar() function, 
% the model that it estimates for the states is *not* a MAR model, 
% but a Gaussian model. That is, even though is called HMM-MAR, the toolbox can 
% actually be used to estimate other models.

%% 
%
% Now that we have the HMM model, we shall compute the spectral information of the states (power, coherence, etc).
% In the case of the HMM-MAR, as we will see below, the MAR parameters themselves contain this spectral information.
% Here, because we are using a Gaussian distribution on wideband power, 
% we don't know what is happening in the frequency
% domain when each state is active, above and beyond gross changes in wideband power. 
%
% However, we can estimate this frequency information, 
% by looking back at the data and using the state time courses we had previosly inferred. 
% For this, we will be using a weighted version (state-wise) of the multitaper, proposed in (Vidaurre et al. 2016).
% In brief, this basically weights the data with the state time course for each state, 
% such that segments of the data where a given state has a higher probability of being active will 
% contribute more to the final spectral estimation.

%%

% We set the options for the spectral estimation:
options = struct();
options.fpass = [1 40]; % frequency range we want to look at, in this case between 1 and 40 Hertzs.
options.tapers = [4 7]; % internal multitaper parameter
options.Fs = 250; % sampling frequency in Hertzs
options.win = 10 * options.Fs; % window length, related to the level of detail of the estimation;
options.order =  0;
options.embeddedlags = 0; 
% that is, if we increase the win parameter, we will obtain an estimation that is more detailed in the frequency scale
% (i.e. contains more frequency bins between 1 and 40 Hertzs) at the expense of some robustness.

% state, the diagonal panels represent power, and the off-diagonal
% panels represent coherence (phase coupling). For simplicity, while we have this
% information for 39 channels covering the entire brain, we just show the
% spectral information here for the low-order visual areas

%%
%
% For the actual HMM-MAR approach, these states are based on autoregressive models, 
% i.e. linear functions that predict each time point as a function
% of its previous data points. Remember that, as opposed to that, the HMM-Gaussian 
% just uses the mean and the covariance of the data, without looking
% to any temporal or spectral relationships in the data.
% Thus, the states of the HMM-MAR:
%
% (i) are spectrally defined, i.e. the characteristics of interest are defined as a function of frequency,
%
% (ii) are based on the raw time series, i.e. we do not need to bandpass filter or compute power envelopes,
%
% (iii) are not only sensitive to power differences but also to phase coupling.
%
% In particular, this script will estimate a group (spectrally-defined) HMM from MEG task data, 
% using two source-reconstructed regions in the primary visual cortex (left and right),

% The HMM with a MAR observation model works well to model spectral changes
% in just a few regions with a rich spectral profile. 
% If we wish to model the entire brain, this model does not work that well
% because it has too many parameters. 
% Instead, we can use a simplification of the MAR model; here, each state
% is defined by a cross-covariance matrix across time and regions.
% (More precisely, it is a low-rank cross-covariance matrix, because we work
% on PCA space.)
% We call this the TDE-HMM, or time-delay embedded HMM.
% At the expense to lose some spectral information that the MAR contains,
% the TDE-HMM is able to model spectral changes across many regions, and,
% like the MAR, is also run on raw data.

% The script follows the paper Vidaurre et al. (2018) Nat Comms, which used
% pure resting-state data

% The HMM is based on the Markovian assumption. That means that, as far as
% the model is concerned, what state is active at each time point depends
% on what state was active in the previous time point. 
% (Strictly speaking, this is a conditional dependency; that is, if you
% knew what state was active in the previous time point for sure, then you
% the state 'now' would be completely independent of all the time points
% before that).
% Given such Markovian assumption, a useful thing to look at is the
% probability of transitioning from one state to another, which is
% contained in the transition probability matrix. 
% 
% Note that the order of the states is arbitrary for each run.

% As we have seen throughout the tutorial, the HMM provides a decomposition
% of the data into states. What properties of the data are these states
% picking up on depends on the type of HMM we are using. In this tutorial,
% we have tried out three types of HMM: the HMM-Gaussian, the HMM-MAR, and
% the TDE-HMM. The HMM overall is unsupervised, and allows us to describe
% both resting-state and task data. With task data, as shown here, we can
% see, later on, how the states are modulated by the task, and how the distribution of
% the states differ across conditions. Another option is to incorporate the
% information of the task (e.g. the stimulus) directly into the model; this
% is illustrated in the osl_example_decoding.m tutorial.
