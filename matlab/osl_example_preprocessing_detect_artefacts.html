%% Preproc - Standard artefact rejection
%
% This example script shows how to perform basic artefact detection and rejection. 
% The main input required is an MEEG object.
%

%%
% A key part of most analysis pipelines is some form of artefact detection and
% rejection. Aside from ICA (and indeed before running ICA) it can be
% important to identify bad channels, epochs, or trials. This functionality is
% provided in OSL by |osl_detect_artefacts| - if you are already familiar with
% OSL, this is essentially the same as |osl_detect_badevent| but a bit cleaner
% and more versatile.

%%
% There are broadly two kinds of artefacts we might want to identify
%
% * Bad channels - where an entire channel should be rejected. Rejection is
%   performed by setting |D.badchannels|
% * Bad times - periods of time in the recording that should be rejected. For
%   continuous recordings, this is performed by setting |D.badsegments|. For
%   epoched recordings, this is performed by setting |D.badtrials|.
%
% To start with, let's load in an MEEG object. We will remove all existing bad channels
D = spm_eeg_load(fullfile(osldir,'example_data','roinets_example','subject_1'));
D = D.badchannels(1:D.nchannels,0);

%%
% First, we can run artefact detection for both bad channels and bad times
D2 = osl_detect_artefacts(D);

%%
% Under the hood, the continuous recording is epoched into dummy trials,
% outliers in those trials are used to identify bad segments, and then those
% bad segments are marked in the original recording (and the temporary epoched
% data is deleted). If you pass in an MEEG object that is already epoched,
% then these epochs/trials will be used instead. This is determined by whether
% |D.type| is continuous or not.
%
% |osl_detect_artefacts| has a number of different options. Firstly, you may
% only want to detect bad channels - for example, if you have a set of trial
% data that hasn't been epoched yet, and want to just mark bad channels first
% (and reject bad trials later)
D2 = osl_detect_artefacts(D,'badtimes',false);

%%
% Alternatively, you may have already marked bad channels and now want to
% identify only bad times
D2 = osl_detect_artefacts(D,'badchannels',false);

%%
% Note that any bad segments, trials, or channels that are already marked will
% be carried forward in |osl_detect_artefacts| - that is, you will not lose
% anything that has already been marked.
%
% Another important parameter you may wish to vary is the artefact rejection
% threshold. This is specified as a signifiance level for the underlying
% outlier test (which is a Generalized ESD test). The default level is |0.05|.
% To detect more artefacts, we can raise this value. You can set thresholds
% for bad channels (|channel_significance|) and bad times
% (|event_significance|) independently. To demonstrate the effect of the
% threshold, compare we can run the artefact detection for bad channels with
% different threshold values.
D2 = osl_detect_artefacts(D,'badtimes',false,'channel_significance',0.01); 

%%
% If we raise the threshold, we find more artefacts
D2 = osl_detect_artefacts(D,'badtimes',false,'channel_significance',0.05);

%%
% And this trend continues
D2 = osl_detect_artefacts(D,'badtimes',false,'channel_significance',0.2);

%%
% You can limit the maximum number of channels that are marked bad if you wish
D2 = osl_detect_artefacts(D,'badtimes',false,'channel_significance',0.05,'max_bad_channels',2);

%%
% You can view the results of your artefact detection using |oslview|. Check
% |osl_detect_artefacts.m| for a full list of options. You can also display
% summary plots of the output for bad channels
D2 = osl_detect_artefacts(D);
report.bad_channels(D2);

%%
% or for bad segments
D2 = osl_detect_artefacts(D,'badchannels',false);
report.bad_segments(D2);

%%
% Note that in this example, the bad segments are caused by bad channels, so
% if the bad channels are removed, then no bad segments are detected. For
% epoched data, use |report.bad_trials| instead of |report.bad_segments|.

%% Modality-specific artefacts
% The artefacts that you detect are specific to a particular modality. This means that artefacts are detected 
% separately in each sensor modality - for example, |MEGMAG| and |MEGPLANAR| could have different bad times.
% In contrast, bad trials are detected across all sensors. You can verify this in |oslview| by changing the
% modality/sensor type. When you specify artefacts manually in |oslview|, they only apply to the selected 
% modality. If you specify bad segments in artefact channels such as EOG or ECG, they will be excluded when
% computing artefact channel correlations in AFRICA.

%% Selecting good samples
% It's important in your analysis to exclude the artefact times. When you mark an artefact, the information is
% stored in the |events| field of the MEEG object. However, all of the data is still present. While SPM
% generally automatically excludes bad data, you need to do this manually when writing your own code. This
% can be accomplished using the |good_samples| function to identify good samples. The function takes in an 
% MEEG object, and optionally a list of channels. It then returns the times when all samples were good. For example
figure
plot(D.time,good_samples(D2))
xlabel('Time')
ylabel('Good sample')
set(gca,'YLim',[-0.1 1.1])

%%
% Each channel has its own list of bad samples, depending on the modality and whether or not the channel was bad. By
% default, |good_samples| will exclude all bad channels, but will aggregate over all remaining channels regardless
% of their modality. In other words, the usage for |good_samples| matches the channels indexed from the MEEG. For example
chans = D.indchantype('ALL','GOOD'); % Retrieve all good channels
dat = D(:,:);
dat = dat(chans,good_samples(D)); % Keep only the good samples

%%
% It might be more common to wish to retrieve only MEG data, in which case you could use
chans = D.indchantype('MEGANY','GOOD'); % Retrieve all good channels
dat = D(:,:);
dat = dat(chans,good_samples(D,chans)); % Keep only the good samples

%%
% Or equivalently (with less memory consumption)
chans = D.indchantype('MEGANY','GOOD'); % Retrieve all good channels
dat = D(chans,:);
dat = dat(:,good_samples(D,chans)); % Keep only the good samples

%%
% Note that if any bad channels are present in the channel list passed to good_samples, all samples will be shown as bad.
% If you have a trial structure, good_samples will return a matrix where the third dimension corresponds to each trial.
%

%% good_samples vs badsamples
% Both the |good_samples| function and |D.badsamples| read events whose type starts with 'artefact' and returns a matrix
% with whether or not the artefact was present. However, there are three key differences between the |good_samples| function and |D.badsamples|
%
% * |good_samples| returns |True| for good samples, whereas |badsamples| returns |True| for bad samples - so they are logically inverted.
% * |good_samples| aggregates over channels, whereas |D.badsamples| does not. This means that |D.good_samples| returns a single vector for all channels, whereas
% |D.badsamples| returns a matrix with one row for each channel. This aggregation makes |good_samples| considerably faster than |D.badsamples|
% * |good_samples| automatically maps modalities across online montages, whereas |D.badsamples| does not. For example, if you perform beamforming, the sensor data
% channel type might be |MEGPLANAR| but the beamformed channels will have channel type |LFP|. Artefacts marked in sensor-space will apply to |MEGPLANAR| but because this 
% modality is different to |LFP|, |D.badsamples| will not recognize any of them as applying to the beamformed data. *This is an extremely serious issue, because it results in
% artefacts remaining in the analysis*. In contrast, |good_samples| will read the online montage, and see that the |LFP| channels are computed from |MEGPLANAR|, so it will
% account for artefacts in both |LFP| and |MEGPLANAR|.
%
% It is recommended to always use |good_samples| instead of |D.badsamples|.
