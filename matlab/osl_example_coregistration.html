##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Coregistration with SPM and RHINO
% This tutorial covers the registration of MRI and M/EEG datasets into a
% common space to allow for analysis in sourcespace.
%
% This practical uses data from the |coreg_example|
% subfolders in the OSL |example_data| directory. Please make sure this
% is present before starting. 
%

%% Coordinate Systems
% There are several co-ordinate systems which must be aligned before we can
% project our sensor MEG data into source space. These are:
%
% * Scanner Coordinates - These are the locations of MEG sensors within the
% dewar.
% * Polhemus Coordinates - These include the relative locations of the Fiducial
% Locations (LPA, RPA and Nasion), Head Position Indicator Coils and
% headshape points. These are acquired prior to the MEG scan.
% * MRI Coordinates - This is the information from the individuals
% structural T1 MRI scan.

%% Coregistration summary
% The coregistration follows these steps
%
% # Extraction of the scalp shape and fiducial points from the MRI scan.
% # Alignment of the MRI and Polhemus data, first by fiducials and refined
% by the scalp and headshape points.
% # Positioning the Polhemus and MRI coordinates within the sensors using
% the Head Position Indicator Coils.
%
% Once these transforms have been identified we can move between MEG
% sensors and specific locations within the MRI scan.
%

%% Setup the analysis
% To start OSL only thing you need to do is to go into your OSL directory 
% (i.e. type _cd /somedirectory/osl-core_ ) and then run the following.
osl_startup;

%%
% This only needs to be run once, each time you re-start MATLAB

%%
% We now setup the location of the data to be coregistered
datadir = fullfile(osldir,'example_data','coreg_example');
spm_files_continuous=[datadir '/Aface_meg1.mat'];

%% Coregistration using SPM
%
% Coregistration is performed in OSL using |osl_headmodel|.
%
% We will first run a standard coregistration using SPM. 
% This takes an option structure defining several key parameters:
%
% * |S.D| - spm object filename
% * |S.mri| - structural mri scan filename
% * |S.useheadshape| - set to 0 or 1 to indicate whether to use the Polhemus
% headshape points to refine the alignment between the MRI and Polhemus
% data
%
% The following example runs standard SPM coregistration on an example dataset. 
% While running, SPM will open
% a window showing the alignment of the headshape points to the scalp.

S = [];
S.D = spm_files_continuous;
S.mri = fullfile(osldir,'example_data','faces_singlesubject','structurals','struct.nii');
S.useheadshape = 1;
S.use_rhino = 0;
S.forward_meg = 'Single Shell';
S.fid.label.nasion = 'Nasion';
S.fid.label.lpa = 'LPA';
S.fid.label.rpa = 'RPA';
D=osl_headmodel(S);

%% View SPM registration
%
% This SPM tool allows us to view the results of the coregistration 
% (click and drag to rotate the image - you may need to click on the 
% "Rotate 3D" toolbar button)
%
% The coregistration shows several types of information:
%
% * Green circles - MEG sensors (from an Elekta System)
% * Pink Diamonds - Fiducial locations (LPA, RPA and Nasion)
% * Light Red Surfact - Scalp extraction
% * Red Surface - Inner skull extraction
% * Blue Surface - Brain surface
% * Tiny Red Dots - Headshape points

%% Coregistration with RHINO
%
% To ensure a good coregistration we must make sure that the alignment
% between the MRI and Polhemus coordinates is as accurate as possible.
% There are several things we can do to improve on the typical pipeline:
% 
% * Having a large number of Polhemus headshape points (>100) to avoid
% local minima in the alignment.
% * Including the nose in the MRI surface extraction and Polhemus headshape
% points. As the head is approximately spherical, it is easy to get a
% rotational error if we just use the scalp. By including parts of the face
% and nose, we can improve the alignment.
%
% RHINO is an OSL tool implementing these additional improvements. You need
% to make sure that you have a clear nose on your MRI scan and a large
% number of headshape points covering the scalp and ridgid parts of the
% face.

datadir = fullfile(osldir,'example_data','coreg_example');
spm_file=[datadir '/pdsubject1'];

S = [];
S.D = spm_file;
S.mri = fullfile(osldir,'example_data','coreg_example','subject1_struct_canon.nii');
S.useheadshape = 1;
S.use_rhino = 1; % We now set the RHINO option to 1
S.forward_meg = 'Single Shell';
S.fid.label.nasion = 'Nasion';
S.fid.label.lpa = 'LPA';
S.fid.label.rpa = 'RPA';
D=osl_headmodel(S);

%% Visualising structural preprocessing
%
% The first time RHINO coregistration is run the structural data will be
% preprocessed using FSL tools. These perform a linear registration, brain
% extraction and scalp extraction from the T1 scan.
%
% More information about RHINO can be found here:
%
% <https://ohba-analysis.github.io/osl-docs/pages/docs/preprocessing.html#coregistration-using-rhino>
%
% We can visualise the extracted scalp surface and original MRI scan in 
% |fsleyes| with the following call.
%
% This will load the structural scan overlayed on the scalp extraction.
% You can turn-off the strutural scan by double clicking on the picture of
% the eye to the left of the label 'subject1_struct_canon.nii' in the
% middle-bottom of the screen. Underneath, the scalp is the boundary 
% between the white (outside) and black (inside) regions.
%
% Try turning the structural scan on and off whilst exploring the
% image. There is a good correspondance between the scalp on the MRI and
% the extracted scalp image. Any deformations in the extracted scalp could 
% be misleading when we align to our headshape points. In this case, the
% structrual preprcessing has worked well.

mri = fullfile(osldir,'example_data','coreg_example','rhino_subject1_struct_canon.nii');
scalp = fullfile(osldir,'example_data','coreg_example','rhino_subject1_struct_canon_scalp.nii.gz');

fsleyes({mri, scalp},[],'greyscale','none')

%% Visualising the RHINO coregistration
%
% We can visualise the full coregistration by calling |rhino_display(D)|.
%
% This contains similar information to the SPM coreg.
%
% * Green Dots - MEG Sensors (from a CTF system including 4 Reference Coils)
% * Magenta Diamonds - MRI Fiducial Locations
% * Cyan Circles - MEG Fiducial Locations
% * Beige Surface - Whole Head Scalp Extraction
% * Pink Surface - Brain Extraction
% * Small Blue-Red Dots - Headshape points colour coded by fit to the
% scalp. Blue indicates a close fit and Red a bad fit. A large number of
% Red headshape points indicates that the general fit might be bad.
%
% You can click and drag the image to explore the registration.
%
% Note the close correspondance between the headshape points and scalp
% extraction. The inclusion of the whole head and nose gives us greater 
% confidence in the quality of the coregistration. Compare the RHINO
% surfaces with those from the SPM output.
%
% This coregistration has worked very well. If you notice any large disparities 
% in future analyses, these should be manually corrected at this stage:
% 
% * Bad scalp extractions can be improved by tuning the FSL BET.
% * Misleading or erroneous headshape points can be removed.
% * Badly estimated Fiducial locations can be reestimated.
