%% ROInets 1 - Introduction to orthogonalization
%
% This example uses synthetic signals to illustrate the effect of orthogonalization.
%
%% TUTORIAL
% Spatial leakage in the beamformer results in correlations between adjacent/nearby
% voxels being introduced, that are not the result of correlations in neural
% activity. As an approximation, this can be corrected for by removing all zero-lag
% correlations. Note that this does not eliminate correlations in the amplitude
% envelopes (although it does decrease them somewhat). By doing this, the remaining
% correlation is assumed to reflect genuine functional connectivity.
% 
% To demonstrate orthogonalization in practice, this example illustrates the use of
% the low-level |ROInets| function |remove_source_leakage()| which implements the
% core orthogonalization algorithms.
%
% We generate a synthetic signal with 3 channels, and a manually specified
% covariance matrix C, using an auto-regressive model. This is done in two steps:
%
%   - first, we generate multi-variate normally distributed noise, using the Cholesky
%   decomposition of the covariance matrix C;
%   - second, we give some temporal structure to that noise by smoothing it in time
%   using an auto-regressive model (see
%   <https://uk.mathworks.com/help/signal/examples/linear-prediction-and-autoregressive-modeling.html
%   this tutorial> for details).  
%
Fs       = 100; % Hz
duration = 5*60; % 5 min
time     = 0:1/Fs:duration;
nTime    = length(time);
nVoxel   = 3;
trueCov  = [ 1.0 -0.1 0.6 ;
            -0.1  1.0 0.3 ;
             0.6  0.3 1.0 ];

% generate random data
b = fir1(1024, 0.5);
[ARfilterTerms, ARnoiseVar] = lpc(b, 7); % AR model
u = randn(nTime,nVoxel) * chol(trueCov * ARnoiseVar); % multi-variate normal
data = filter(1, ARfilterTerms, u).'; % temporal smoothing, data is nVoxel-by-nTime

% The |remove_source_leakage()| function takes in the data matrix, as well as the
% orthogonalization method. To apply symmetric orthogonalization, we can simply call:
tic
data_orthog = ROInets.remove_source_leakage(data, 'symmetric');
toc

% Now, the channels have no static zero-lag correlation
corrcoef(data_orthog')

%%
% However, the amplitude of the orthogonalized signals is quite different to the
% original signals
std(data.')
std(data_orthog.')

%%
% The 'closest' orthogonalization method also results in orthogonal signals, but
% iteratively rotates and scales the basis vectors to best preserve the original
% signals. As a result, the orthogonalized signals are still uncorrelated, but their
% amplitudes much better match the original signals
data_orthog_closest = ROInets.remove_source_leakage(data, 'closest');
corrcoef(data_orthog_closest.')
std(data_orthog_closest.')

% The 'closest' orthogonalization method also results in orthogonal signals, but
% iteratively rotates and scales the basis vectors to best preserve the original
% signals. As a result, the orthogonalized signals are still uncorrelated, but their
% amplitudes much better match the original signals

%% EXERCISES
% 1. Have a closer look at the outcome of the orthogonalisation procedures, using
% simple superimposed plotting or compute correlations between the different
% orthogonalization.
%
% 2. Also, try to model a situation where one parcel gets a lot of signal from
% another one (due to a bad parcellation, for example). This can be modeled by
% increasing the correlation between e.g. parcel 1 and 3 as defined by the matrix
% multiplied in variable C (i.e. change both values of 0.6 to 0.9, for example).
% Check the outcome of the orthogonalization. Have a look at how much the
% orthogonalization changes the original signal (by simply plotting over each other
% or by calculating the correlation coefficient). What happens with the similarity
% between the original and the 'closest' orthogonalisation if there is this elevated
% mixing of signals in comparison to the example in the practical?
% 
% 3. Why would someone want to use 'symmetric' over 'closest' orthogonalization if it
% matches the original time-series so much better in terms of amplitude? Increase the
% dimensionality and/ or length of fthe time courses? and compare runtimes. Also,
% check how these two time-series compare (correlation or simple visual inspection).
