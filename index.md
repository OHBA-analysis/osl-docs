The OHBA Software Library (OSL) is created by the OHBA Analysis Group, OHBA, Oxford, UK.

OSL is a set of Matlab tools and scripts for running M/EEG analysis on CTF and Elekta Neuromag data, and is written mainly by members of the OHBA Analysis Group. It uses a combination of FSL, SPM and Fieldtrip.

OSL includes OAT (OSLâ€™s easy Analysis Tool), which can be used to analyse a multi-subject MEG study in source or sensor space.
